# Cats & Dogs Classification using SVM
# Image Classification using SVM
This project demonstrates a basic image classification pipeline using classical machine learning techniques. It involves loading and preprocessing images, extracting features, and training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to recognize different classes.

# ðŸ§° Technologies Used
â€¢ Python

â€¢ NumPy, Pandas

â€¢ OpenCV for image processing

â€¢ scikit-learn for machine learning (SVM, evaluation metrics)

â€¢ Matplotlib for visualization

â€¢ tqdm for progress tracking

# ðŸš€ Features
â€¢ Load and preprocess image datasets

â€¢ Assign labels to images manually

â€¢ Split dataset into training and testing sets

â€¢ Train SVM classifier

# Evaluate model using:
â€¢ Accuracy

â€¢ Confusion Matrix

â€¢ Classification Report

# ðŸ“Š Results
â€¢ The notebook concludes with evaluation metrics such as accuracy score and a confusion matrix to assess the modelâ€™s performance.
